# Contributing for Hacktoberfest 2022

This project was open to Hacktoberfest 2022 and will be open to Hacktoberfest 2023.

I will mostly only consider pull requests for the specified issues, or for grammar and spelling corrections.

If there is any need for new sample stories, they should be family friendly.

As much as possible, avoid using any terminology that was at one time trademarked.
