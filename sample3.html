        <h2>Sample #3: Artist Statement</h2>
        <div id="libbable">
            <p>John K. Ford is a highly respected visual artist specializing in <span class="fillable">verb, past tense</span> <span class="fillable">noun</span> paintings. John's dream-like process involves re&shy;con&shy;tex&shy;tualizing <span class="fillable">adjective</span> paradigms viewed with <span class="fillable">noun, abstract</span> through the filter of <span class="fillable">another verb, past tense</span> <span class="fillable">historical era</span> norms. By questioning the boundaries of <span class="fillable">breakfast food</span> to shift perceptions of the <span class="fillable">sports team</span> while maintaining a skeptical stance towards <span class="fillable">dog breed, plural</span>, John K. Ford pulls off an enigmatically <span class="fillable">another adjective</span> transformation of modularized <span class="fillable">cereal brand</span> cul&shy;ture that resonates with realigned modes of <span class="fillable">noun, abstract</span>.</p>
            <p>John K. Ford is also very interested in prob&shy;lem&shy;a&shy;tizing <span class="fillable">type of shoe, plural</span> in their liminal space, while simultaneously re-energizing a con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly deferred relationship. Thus, the traditional <span class="fillable">motor vehicle</span> is both subverted and restored. Narratives of <span class="fillable">fish, plural</span>, identity mortality, loss and love are intertwined in a dialogical re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship interrogating <span class="fillable">math term, plural</span>.</p>
            <p>John K. Ford's work is in numerous public and private collections, most notable the Metropolitan <span class="fillable">small town</span> Museum of <span class="fillable">noun, capitalized</span>.</p>
