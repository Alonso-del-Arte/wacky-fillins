        <h2>Sample #3: Artist Statement</h2>
        <div id="libbable">
            <p>John K. Ford is a highly respected visual artist, always mindful of counter-epis&shy;te&shy;mol&shy;ogy, specializing in <span class="fillable">verb, past tense</span> <span class="fillable">noun</span> paintings. John's dream-like process involves re&shy;con&shy;tex&shy;tualizing <span class="fillable">adjective</span> paradigms viewed with <span class="fillable">noun, abstract</span> through the filter of <span class="fillable">another verb, past tense</span> <span class="fillable">historical era</span> norms. By questioning the boundaries of <span class="fillable">breakfast food</span> to shift perceptions of the <span class="fillable">sports team</span> as child-like theater while maintaining a skeptical stance towards <span class="fillable">dog breed, plural</span> in the indeterminate space between connotation and denotation, John K. Ford pulls off an enigmatically <span class="fillable">another adjective</span> trans&shy;formation of modularized <span class="fillable">cereal brand</span> cul&shy;ture that resonates with realigned modes of <span class="fillable">another abstract noun</span> and the destabilization of the reality principle. These are elided with powerful acts of es&shy;trange&shy;ment that simultaneously unsettle and comfort.</p>
            <p>John K. Ford is also very interested in prob&shy;lem&shy;a&shy;tizing artificial constructs of <span class="fillable">type of shoe, plural</span> in their liminal space, while simultaneously re-energizing a con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly deferred re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship. Thus, the traditional <span class="fillable">motor vehicle</span> is both subverted and restored. Narratives of aporia, <span class="fillable">fish, plural</span>, identity, mortality, loss and love are intertwined in a dialogical re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship interrogating <span class="fillable">math term, plural</span> in a complex <span class="fillable">dance step</span> of semiotics, as well as negotiating the dialectic between conflicting discourses of <span class="fillable">article of clothing, plural</span> in societal discourse and the <span class="fillable">color</span> cusp of post-capitalist consumer politics which interrogate the assumptions of the American dream and highlight the conflicts inherent in postmodern urbanism.</p>
            <p>In 2015, John K. Ford was artist-in-residence at the <span class="fillable">type of container, capitalized</span> Gallery in <span class="fillable">fictional place</span>. This experience awakened in him an awareness of how ethnography is embedded in place in a way that his ho&shy;mog&shy;e&shy;nized Seattle birthplace could not, col&shy;lapsing implied partititions between per&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tive awareness, art and doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tation.</p>
            <p>John K. Ford's work is in numerous public and private collections, most notably the Metropolitan <span class="fillable">small town</span> Museum of <span class="fillable">noun, capitalized</span>.</p>
