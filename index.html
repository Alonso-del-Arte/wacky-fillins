        <h1>Wacky Fill-Ins</h1>
        <h2>The Basic Idea</h2>
        <p>Basically, you have an incomplete story with blanks, and you can fill in those blanks to create a finished story that might not make much sense narratively but is unexpectedly hillarious. See <code>README.md</code> for a more detailed explanation of the basic idea.</p>
        <h2>How to Write Your Own Wacky Fill-Ins</h2>
        <p>You don't have to know JavaScript to write your own Wacky Fill-Ins, but it really helps to know HTML, and, to a lesser extent, CSS. You can use any of the three sample files (<a href="sample1.html">sample1.html</a>, <a href="sample2.html">sample2.html</a>, <a href="sample3.html">sample3.html</a>) as a template.</p>
